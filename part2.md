## Q1: Define what is a Microservices architecture and how does it differ from a Monolithic application.
**Microservices:** An architectural style with small, independent services.
**Monolithic:** Single, tightly integrated application.

## Q2: Compare Microservices and Monolithic architectures by listing their respective pros and cons.
**Microservices Pros:** Scalability, technology flexibility.
**Microservices Cons:** Distributed complexity, data management challenges.
**Monolithic Pros:** Simplicity, easier debugging.
**Monolithic Cons:** Limited scalability, technology stack constraints.

## Q3: In a Micoservices architecture, explain how should the application be split and why.
Split based on business capabilities for independence and scalability.

## Q4: Briefly explain the CAP theorem and its relevance to distributed systems and Microservices.
CAP theorem states trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. In Microservices, architects make choices based on specific requirements.

## Q5: What consequences on the architecture ?
Consequences include trade-offs, architectural decisions, resilience, and consistency models.

## Q6: Provide an example of how microservices can enhance scalability in a cloud environment.
Microservices enable independent scaling of services based on demand in a cloud environment.

## Q7: What is statelessness and why is it important in microservices architecture ?
Statelessness in Microservices means no reliance on shared state, enabling scalability, resilience, and simplicity.

## Q8: What purposes does an API Gateway serve ?
API Gateway routes requests, aggregates data, enforces security policies, and handles load balancing for microservices.
